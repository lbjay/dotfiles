# Quick shortcut to the default $EDITOR.
#
# This means that as I travel back and forth between setting different editors
# as my default I don't need to keep track of their executable name.
#
# This is an executable rather than a bash function because it hangs otherwise.
#
# This script came from:
# https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/e
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ edit
#   $ edit .
#   # => opens the current directory in your editor
#
#   $ edit /usr/local
#   # => opens the specified directory in your editor

exec "$EDITOR" "${1:-.}"
